    <h1>Worksheet 3: "Cellular Organelle Storyboard"</h1>
    <p>Objective: Create a visual representation of the cellular organelles' functions in the form of a storyboard using the Pan de Polvo analogy.</p>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Choose three key cellular organelles from the previous worksheets.</li>
        <li>Create a storyboard with at least three frames illustrating the functions of each selected organelle during the Pan de Polvo analogy.</li>
        <li>Include captions or brief descriptions for each frame, explaining the role of the organelle in the cellular context and its corresponding step in the Pan de Polvo baking process.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><b>Storyboard Frames Example:</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Frame 1: Nucleus - Show the nucleus as the "recipe book" guiding the entire Pan de Polvo process.</li>
        <li>Frame 2: Mitochondria - Depict the mitochondria as the "oven" providing energy for the baking process.</li>
        <li>Frame 3: Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER) - Illustrate the ER as the "mixing bowl" where ingredients are prepared and organized.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><i>For Teachers: Encourage students to be creative in their visual representations and to clearly articulate the connections between cellular organelles and the Pan de Polvo analogy.</i></p>
