    <h1>Worksheet 3: "Gastropod Ecology and Adaptations"</h1>
    <p>Objective: Explore the ecological role and adaptations of gastropods in their environments.</p>
    <p>Adaptations and Survival:</p>

    <p>Choose one gastropod species identified during the exploration..</p>
    <p>Describe the adaptations that help it survive in its environment.</p>
    <p>Discuss how these adaptations contribute to the gastropod's role in the ecosystem.</p>


    <p>Ecosystem Importance:</p>
    <p>Research and list the ways in which gastropods are important in ecosystems.</p>
    <p>Create a visual representation (diagram, chart, or infographic) to illustrate the relationships between gastropods and other organisms in the ecosystem.</p>
    <p>Discussion:</p>
    <p>Discuss how gastropods are both beneficial and challenging for humans, considering their impact on crops and their importance in ecosystems.</p>
    <p>Explore potential ways to coexist with gastropods in urban and agricultural settings.</p>
